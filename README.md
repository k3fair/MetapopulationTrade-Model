# MetapopulationTrade-Model
Simulation and visualization code for manuscript by Fair, Bauch, and Anand (2021). Model describes a system where agricultural land area, food supply, and human population growth are coupled. Associated preprint is posted at ???.

To run a set of simulations make all required option selections (detailed within each script) and launch the appropriate script.

All data needed to run scripts are included in the "InputFiles" folder.

## Scripts

* **covidHier0.35Lite_singlepatch_scenarios.R** runs simulations for different NPI scenarios, visualizes results and outputs figure




## Input files

* **COVIDsim_CCS_fadeoutdat_X.R**, where X is a placeholder for the parameter being varied, contains data on fade-outs and infections from simulations generated using covidHier0.35Lite_singlepatch_parametervary.R


## System & hardware requirements

 * Windows 10 Pro Version 2004

 * Sufficient RAM to support storage of data structures during simulations

## Installation guides

All software should install within a few minutes on a standard computer, the versions listed here are those the scripts have been tested on.

 * MATLAB R2016b https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html
